# Energy-Efficient-Protocols-for-IoT-Devic
As part of a class project at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar, I explored energy-efficient solutions for IoT networks. My research focused on optimizing Wireless Sensor Networks using techniques like clustering algorithms and energy-aware routing, aiming to address sustainability challenges and improve network performance.
